You can call me Dr.! 😏🎓

This is not just the highlight of my 2024 – it is truly the best thing in my life so far! Two months ago, I successfully defended my PhD on 'Diversity in Programming Education', with summa cum laude!

The day of my defense reflected the emotional rollercoaster of these past few years. My 19-year-old self, growing up in a small Bavarian village with a high school grade of 3.1 (after three tries, whoopsie), would never have imagined actually becoming a Dr. rer. nat.! And honestly, neither did anyone else back then.

While I am incredibly happy about my professional milestones and the inspiring people I have met on this journey, I am most grateful for my beloved friends. Through every pre-deadline breakdown, moments of self-doubt, and all the stress that comes with a PhD (and life in general), they supported me unconditionally, making every achievement even more meaningful to celebrate together.

After this PhD, I know more than ever that it only takes one person to believe in you and your dreams to give you the courage to keep going and thrive, especially at a young age. Be that person—whether for yourself or for others.💜
