In the spirit of beloved Goethe, who believed “Das Lehren ist das höchste Verstehen”, I’m super happy to be honored with the Best Teaching Award at the Faculty of Computer Science and Mathematics of Universität Passau! 🎓✨ 

Working at university is not just about research and teaching is not just a job — it is a commitment to nurturing the next generation of minds, laying the foundation for sustainable and impactful research. 🌟🚀

This recognition also underscores the value of practical, team-based, and hands-on modules in computer science programs such as the Advanced Software Product Development module. 🤖

Grateful to everyone who's been part of this journey so far — especially some of my inspiring students and my supportive colleagues at University of Passau. 🎉

It's not just a personal win; it's a celebration of the collective effort shaping the future of computer science education. 💜
