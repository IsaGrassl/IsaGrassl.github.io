Good morning, Visiting Professor Dr. Isabella Graßl!

Wait... what? I still haven’t quite got used to *Dr.*, and now—bam!—it’s *Visiting Professor Dr.*

It feels so surreal. What I’ve wished for ever since I began my studies has come true. I’m a (visiting) professor now.

As of March, I am the first Gender-MINT visiting professor in Computer Science for two years. The first year is funded through the Professorship Programme III by the Federal Government and the States, and the second year is funded by the department itself.

Exciting times lie ahead!
