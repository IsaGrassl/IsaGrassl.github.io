> Das Lehren ist das höchste Verstehen — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

My experience fuels my passion for inclusive education. I strive to create spaces where students, regardless of background or experience, feel heard, valued, and empowered.  

As a first-generation university student, I navigated the academic world without prior exposure to computer science. Intimidated by stereotypes and the advanced skills of my peers, I initially struggled to see myself in this field. Through this journey, I learned the value of active listening and empathy—qualities often overlooked in software engineering but essential for inclusive learning environments.
