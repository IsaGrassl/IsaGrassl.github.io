> Das Lehren ist das höchste Verstehen — Johann Wolfgang von Goethe


My teaching philosophy is deeply influenced by my own background as a first-generation university
student from a non-academic family. This journey was filled with challenges by navigating through
the academic landscape without prior exposure to computer science, especially programming.
Intimidated by the stereotypical nerdy image of programmers as well as their profound skills
compared to mine, I initially found it difficult to see myself in this field. Through this journey, I
have also learned the importance of active listening and empathy—skills that allow me to better
understand and connect with others. I believe these qualities are often underemphasized in software
engineering, yet they are crucial for fostering a supportive and inclusive learning and working
environment. This personal experience fuels my passion for making education more accessible and
relatable for children and students from diverse backgrounds. By incorporating these elements into
my teaching, I strive to create a space where students regardless of their prior experience or
background feel heard and valued.
