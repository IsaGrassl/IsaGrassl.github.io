I am a [Visiting Professor](https://www.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/fb20/ueber_uns_details_315392.en.jsp) at Technical University of Darmstadt, specialising in Gender in Computer Science.

Previously, I worked as a Research Associate at the University of Cambridge (UK) and completed my PhD on [Diversity in Programming](https://opus4.kobv.de/opus4-uni-passau/frontdoor/index/index/year/2024/docId/1504) at University of Passau (Germany) with **summa cum laude**.

<p>With academic backgrounds in both computer science and the humanities, my research takes an interdisciplinary approach. I focus on the **human and social aspects of software engineering**, exploring how **diversity**—whether in terms of gender, cultural and ethnic background, beliefs, professional experience, or disabilities—affects collaboration in software teams. At its core, my work aims to better understand how people interact in software teams and how effective collaboration can enhance code quality. </p>
